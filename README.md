# rockpaperscissors

This is a project that demostrates my beginner JavaScript knowledge in a rock, paper, scissors game. 
As you can see, the game demonstrates the skills for loops, functions, and if/else statements. 

One thing that I specifically got to work on in this project is learning the correct comparisons for values, specifically when I am comparing the computer choice to the human choice. I had to use "===" instead of "=", since a single "=" is designed to set values, whereas "===" compares both value and type, which is critical in getting proper gameplay. 

Enjoy my proof of concept!
